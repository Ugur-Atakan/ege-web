Issued by the state authorities, the document is evidence that your company is legally permitted to conduct business activities as a properly registered company within that particular state. However, it is important to note that the Certificate of Good Standing is not a business license, which is in fact required to be obtained in order to legally conduct business. Usually, a company can legally conduct business without obtaining a Certificate of Good Standing. '/>
