    "certificate_of_amendment_header4_text": "If you need to make changes to your company’s original Certificate of Incorporation (Corporation) or Certificate of Formation (LLC), then filing an amendment with the State of Delaware is what you must do. In other words, state governments, including Delaware, require that a company files a Certificate of Amendment when making an addition to, deleting from, or otherwise altering the existing provisions of the formation documents. For instance, if you think your company’s name is outdated, or not sufficient for business operations, you should file a Certificate of Amendment with the state, instead of forming a new company. Again, if you need to increase the number of shares that your corporation can authorize, filing an amendment is what you need. But you do not need to do this by yourself. We, as Registate, can file an amendment quickly and efficiently for you. Or you would like to gather all amendment certificates and have one single, consolidated Certificate of Incorporation/Formation to reflect the current situation of the company. Then, restatement is what you need.",

    "dba_header4_text1": "DBA names can be beneficial for sole proprietorships, they’re also helpful for other types of companies, like LLCs and corporations. Here are a couple of reasons a company might want to obtain a DBA name",
    "dba_header4_text2": "Registering a domain. Sometimes, the domain you want is unavailable, and you end up marketing your services under a separate name. For example, the owner of “Sharpest Tools, LLC” decides to build a website but can’t secure their LLC name as the domain. Instead, they register the domain “LocalTools.com.” To sell under this name, they obtain a DBA name for “Local Tools.",
    "dba_header4_text3": "Branching out into new services. You might form a company for one service or product only to branch out in another direction down the road. For instance, if your company, “Luna’s Locks, Co.” sells hair care products and branches out into supplements, you might not want to sell your vitamin and supplement line under the same name. Instead of creating a new company, you can secure a DBA name to sell these products under a separate name.",
    "dba_header4_text4": "Once you’ve decided you’d like to obtain a DBA name, you’ll need to register for one. Registering a DBA name is typically a straightforward process, but the steps can vary from state to state.",
